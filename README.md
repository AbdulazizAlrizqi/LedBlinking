# Led With Arduino
this repository contain two images for the same circute and the code of the arduino 
the circute contain led and pushbutton connect with the ardiono so whan we push the button the led go in high state and when we let the button the led go to low state

## circute design.png
in this file you can see the circute design and the cables that connect with the arduino

## button pushed and led lightning.png
here you can see when we start the simulation in tinkercad and we pushed the button the led go in high state when we let the button the led go in low state

## code.ino
here you can find the code that we made in arduino to connect the led with the button
